#### 2. Projects:
 > In this section we will discuss the projects completed and currently undertaken by me.

* Hackathon Medical App: Building a medical app which contained all the common diseases with their basic home remedies PLUS emergency number of nearby doctors. I was given the part of researching about the different diseases, challenges, and understanding how the app will work.

* Rock, Paper, Scissor game: Developed this project using random.RandInt which will assign random integers from 1 to 3, which will assign 1 to Rock(r), assign 2 to Paper(p), and assign 3 to Scissor(s) to computers turn. Then, it will compare both values and print whether its a tie, we won or lost. A similar version of this same project will be snake, water, gun game.
