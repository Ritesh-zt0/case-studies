#### 1. Case Studies:
 > In this section we will discuss the case studies completed and currently undertaken by me. Acquired data analysis skills with Google Data Analytics Course.

* Bellabeat Case Study: This case study involved the usage of data analytics to complete the task of Analysing data from smart devices can help us understand the ways consumers use our product and to launch products that will help them and help in growth opportunities for the company. Solved using R language in Kaggle notebook.

* Stock Prices Prediction using LSTM: This case study/project is used to predict the stock prices using LSTM (long short term memory). LSTM is a variety of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that are capable of learning long-term dependencies, especially in sequence prediction problems.

* Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study: This case study in progress is regarding Cyclistic Bike-Share focusing on solving the task: Analysing data from annual and casual members alongside historical bike trip data to identify trends on how casual and annual members use the service alongside their preferred travelling days, duration of their travel, and which type of bikes are used, for growth opportunities of the company as well as how we can convert casual members to annual members.

* UCL Winners Kit Manufacturer: In this case study, I tried to analyse why there are now only 2 kit manufacturer, i.e, Adidas and Nike, whose sponsored team win UEFA Champions League regularly, whereas 20-25 years ago different local kit manufacturers used to make kits of UCL winning sides.

#### 2. Projects:
 > In this section we will discuss the projects completed and currently undertaken by me.

* Portfolio Website: With this project, I tried to make a website for my portfolio which contains all my projects, case studies, experience, and about me. Used github pages to build this website.
[Portfolio Website.](https://ritesh-zt0.github.io/riteshkumar.github_portfolio.io/)
 
* Python Projects: 
  1. Weather Text-to-Speech: Created a basic text-to-speech python program that takes the input of a city's name, using API key and importing win32com.client for the speak/say functionality in Windows OS.
 [Weather TTS.](https://github.com/Ritesh-zt0/riteshkumar.github_portfolio.io/blob/main/Projects/weather_text_to_speech.py)
 
  2. Rock, Paper, Scissor game: Developed this project using random.RandInt which will assign random integers from 1 to 3, which will assign 1 to Rock(r), assign 2 to Paper(p), and assign 3 to Scissor(s) to computers turn. Then, it will compare both values and print whether its a tie, we won or lost. A similar version of this same project will be snake, water, gun game.

  3. Image Resizer: Used import cv2 to create a new image that is created by scaling the original image with different configurable parameters such as source, destination, and scale percent.
[Image Resizer.](https://github.com/Ritesh-zt0/riteshkumar.github_portfolio.io/blob/main/Projects/image_resizer.py)

* Final Year B.E Project: The project topic was Secured Wireless Communication using RSA cryptography, we learnt about different types of cryptography and socket programming alongside databases.
[B.E Final Project.](https://github.com/Ritesh-zt0/riteshkumar.github_portfolio.io/blob/main/Projects/Final%20BE%20Blackbook.pdf)
 
* Hackathon Medical App: Building a medical app which contained all the common diseases with their basic home remedies PLUS emergency number of nearby doctors. I was given the part of researching about the different diseases, challenges, and understanding how the app will work.
